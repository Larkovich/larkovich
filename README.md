# üëã Hi there, I'm Sebastian!

## About Me

I'm an IT engineer specializing in **Cloud Solution Architecture**, with a strong focus on DevOps, Cloud, and Platform Engineering. By trade, I build, automate, and maintain robust, scalable infrastructure in cloud environments.  

I'm a Linux fanboy at heart üêß, passionate about scripting (Bash, Go, Python), containerization (Docker), service catalog tools (Backstage), and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).  

I enjoy automating everything I can (because why do it twice?), and I‚Äôm always exploring new ways to improve reliability, security, and developer experience.  

Currently, I'm also diving deeper into **Cybersecurity** (I'm pursuing a master's in it), combining my hacker mindset with infrastructure know-how.  

I've got a soft spot for AI and machine learning && experimenting, learning, and thinking about how it can supercharge cloud and automation workflows.  

(Used to be a web developer once upon a time ‚Äî so I appreciate clean code and solid design.)

## What I Do

- **Cloud & DevOps**: Automating deployments, managing infrastructure, building pipelines, and ensuring everything runs smoothly in the cloud (AWS enthusiast).  
- **Platform Engineering**: Crafting developer friendly internal platforms, service catalogs (like Backstage), and CI/CD workflows.  
- **Systems Administration**: Managing Linux systems like home üêß.  
- **Cybersecurity**: Always curious about security, from hardening systems to ethical hacking techniques.  
- **Scripting & Automation**: Bash, Go, Python - automating the boring stuff so humans don't have to.  
- **AI Experimentation**: Playing with AI tools and ideas to make tech smarter.

## What You'll Find Here

On this GitHub, you'll find projects and experiments around DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, Platform Engineering, Automation Scripts, and a bit of cybersecurity research.  

I share things I learn, tools I build, and sometimes half baked ideas that might be useful to others.
